				"A skunk and a deuce voids the score for that series only and draws a penalty of 2 chips placed in the \"kitty,\" and loss of dice. \nTWO skunks void the ENTIRE accumulated score and draws a penalty of 4 chips placed in the \"kitty,\" and loss of dice. \nPlayer must again start to score from scratch. \nThe first player to accumulate a total of 100 or more points can continue to score as many points over 100 as he believes is needed to win. \nWhen he decides to stop, his total score is the goal. /nEach succeeding player receives one more chance to better the goal and end the game. \nThe winner of each game collects all chips in \"kitty\" and in addition five chips from each losing player or 10 chips from any player without a score. \n");
